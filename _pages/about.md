Welcome to my github page.

My name is Amine Echraibi. I am currently a PhD student at Institut Mines-Télécom Atlantique (IMT Atlantique), working on probabilistic graphical models and variational inference.

I hold an engineering diploma from IMT Atlantique in the field of information processing & computer science, and a master's degree in research from Université de Rennes 1. My main education is at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, and mostly revolves around: probability theory, advanced calculus, and machine learning.

My research focuses on (deep) probabilistic graphical models, and approximate inference methods (MCMC & Variational Inference), for a list of publications check out my google scholar.
